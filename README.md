# GitHub Follow Checker

A simple Python script to compare who you follow on GitHub with who follows you back.
It outputs a `.csv` file listing users that **you follow but who do not follow you back**.

---

## 🚀 How to Use

### 1. Clone this Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/github-follow-checker.git

Create a file named `.env` with the following content:

```dotenv
